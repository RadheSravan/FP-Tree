This is a git repository for FP tree implementation in C. Check the project wiki for the explanation of code.

USAGE

Pre-requisites :

2. Change the minSup and minConf values in fpgrowth in accordance with the transactions populated.

Compiling the code : 

Run 'make' in the home directory of the project. This generates the output file 'fpgrowth' in the same directory.
